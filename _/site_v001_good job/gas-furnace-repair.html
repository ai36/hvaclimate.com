                            When it comes to gas furnace repair, we're true professionals dedicated to your comfort and
                            safety.
                            Our service isn't just a fix; it's a complete restoration of your heating equipment's
                            functionality.
                            We start with a thorough diagnosis to identify all issues, whether it's a minor burner fault
                            or
                            a
                            major control system breakdown. Then we move on to replacing or repairing damaged
                            components—from
                            fans to thermostats, ensuring everything operates perfectly.

                            your equipment to guarantee its efficient and safe operation for years to come. This means
                            you'll

                        <summary>Gas furnace blow cold air. What can I do?</summary>
                        <p>
                            If your gas boiler is blowing cold air, it could indicate several potential issues. Here are
                            some steps you can take to diagnose and possibly fix the problem:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Check the thermostat: Make sure the thermostat is set to heating mode and the
                                temperature is set higher than the current room temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Verify programming settings: If you have a programmable thermostat, ensure it's
                                programmed correctly for the time of day and desired temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect air filters: Clogged filters can obstruct normal airflow, reducing heating
                                efficiency. If filters are dirty, replace them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check vents: Ensure all vents and registers are open and not blocked by furniture or
                                drapes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Look for airflow blockages: Check external air ducts for any obstructions or clogs that
                                could hinder air circulation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Restart the system: Sometimes, resetting the boiler can fix a temporary issue. Turn off
                                the boiler's power for a few minutes, then turn it back on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect the burner flame: If you have access and knowledge, check to see if the boiler's
                                burner flame is lit. A non-lit flame could indicate a gas supply problem or a burner
                                malfunction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check the heating system for leaks: Leaks in the heating system can lead to heat loss
                                and insufficient heating.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            If the problem persists after these steps or you're unsure about performing them, it's
                            strongly recommended to contact a professional heating technician for service and repair. A
                            technician can accurately diagnose the issue and suggest the appropriate repairs. Attempting
                            to intervene without proper knowledge and skills can be dangerous.

                        <summary>Gas furnace leaking water. What should you do first?</summary>
                        <p>If your gas furnace is leaking water, it's important to address the issue promptly to prevent
                            further damage to your furnace and your home. Here's what you should do first:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Turn Off the Power to the Furnace: Safety first. Before inspecting or touching your
                                furnace, ensure that the power is turned off. This can usually be done at the furnace
                                switch or the main electrical panel.</li>
                            <li>Identify the Source of the Leak: Try to locate where the water is coming from. Common
                                sources of leaks in a gas furnace include the condensation line, the humidifier (if your
                                furnace is equipped with one), or the heat exchanger.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Condensation Leak: High-efficiency gas furnaces produce condensation which is
                                    drained away from the unit. A clogged condensation drain or a break in the line can
                                    cause leaks.</li>
                                <li>Humidifier Leak: If your furnace has an integrated humidifier, it might be leaking
                                    water due to a clog or malfunction.</li>
                                <li>Heat Exchanger Leak: This is more serious, as it could indicate a crack in the heat
                                    exchanger, which can lead to a carbon monoxide leak.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Contain the Leak: If possible, try to contain the leak by placing a bucket or towels to
                                catch the water. This can help minimize water damage to your home while you work on a
                                more permanent solution.</li>
                            <li>Inspect and Clear the Condensate Line: If the leak is coming from the condensate line,
                                check for any clogs or blockages. You can try to clear the line yourself using a wet/dry
                                vacuum on the line's exterior end.</li>
                            <li>Check the Furnace Filter: A dirty furnace filter can restrict airflow, causing the coil
                                to freeze and then leak water when it melts. If the filter is dirty, replace it.</li>
                            <li>Call a Professional: Unless the solution is simple and safe, like changing a dirty
                                filter or unclogging a condensation line, it's best to call a professional HVAC
                                technician. This is especially true if you suspect the leak is coming from the heat
                                exchanger or if you can't identify the source of the leak.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Remember, regular maintenance of your furnace can help prevent issues like water leaks. Make
                            sure to have your furnace inspected and serviced by a professional annually.</p>

                            Eugene is very responsive, showed up on time, was professional throughout the entire time
                            and completed the jobs in a timely manner. I’ve recommended him to both my parents and
                            in-laws and they have used his services and really liked the outcome. I highly recommend his
                            company to anyone looking to get work done on their HVAC system. Very professional,
                            knowledgeable and reasonably priced.
