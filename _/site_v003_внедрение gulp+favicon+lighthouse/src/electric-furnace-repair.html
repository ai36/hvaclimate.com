                        <summary>Electric furnace blow cold air. What can I do?</summary>
                        <p>
                            If your electric furnace is blowing cold air, there are several steps you can take to
                            troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue before calling in a professional. Here’s what
                            you can do:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Check the Thermostat: Make sure it's set to "heat" and the temperature setting is higher
                                than the current room temperature. Sometimes, the issue might be as simple as incorrect
                                settings or a low battery.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect the Air Filter: A clogged air filter can restrict airflow and affect the
                                furnace's ability to heat your home. Check the air filter and replace it if it's dirty.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check the Circuit Breakers: Ensure that the furnace’s circuit breaker hasn't tripped. If
                                it has, reset it. If it trips again, there may be a more serious electrical issue that
                                needs professional attention.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Examine the Air Ducts: Look for any leaks, disconnections, or blockages in the ductwork.
                                Leaky or blocked ducts can cause warm air to escape before it reaches your living
                                spaces.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect the Blower Motor: If the blower motor is not working correctly, it might not be
                                circulating warm air properly. Listen for unusual noises or check for any signs of
                                malfunction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Look at the Heating Elements: In electric furnaces, the heating elements may have burned
                                out. However, inspecting or replacing them should be done by a professional due to the
                                high risk of electrical shock.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Thermostat Calibration: An improperly calibrated thermostat can misread the room
                                temperature, causing the furnace to blow cold air. Calibration is best done by a
                                professional.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                System Reset: Sometimes, simply resetting the furnace can fix the issue. Turn off the
                                power to the furnace at the breaker, wait a few minutes, and then turn it back on.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            If after trying these steps your furnace is still blowing cold air, it may indicate a more
                            serious issue that requires professional diagnosis and repair. Issues such as a
                            malfunctioning control board, problems with the furnace's sequencer (which controls the
                            heating elements), or other electrical problems are complex and should be addressed by a
                            qualified technician.

                        <summary>Electric furnace not working. What to check before calling a specialist?</summary>
                        <p>If your electric furnace is not working, there are a few things you can check yourself before
                            calling in a specialist. These steps can help you identify simple issues that you might be
                            able to resolve on your own, saving time and money. However, if you're not comfortable
                            performing any of these checks, it's best to call a professional.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Thermostat Settings: Ensure the thermostat is set to "heat" and the temperature is set
                                higher than the current room temperature. Also, check if the thermostat is operational
                                (it may need new batteries if it's battery-operated).</li>
                            <li>Power Supply: Verify that your furnace’s circuit breaker is in the "on" position in your
                                electrical panel. Sometimes, a power surge can trip the breaker. If it trips again after
                                being reset, there might be an electrical issue requiring professional attention.</li>
                            <li>Emergency Switch: Some furnaces have an emergency or safety switch that looks like a
                                regular light switch, located on or near the furnace. Ensure this switch hasn’t been
                                accidentally turned off.</li>
                            <li>Air Filter: A clogged air filter can restrict airflow and cause the furnace to overheat
                                and shut off. Check the air filter and replace it if it's dirty.</li>
                            <li>Furnace Door: Ensure the furnace door is properly closed. Some furnaces have a safety
                                switch that prevents them from operating if the door is open.</li>
                            <li>Blower Motor: Listen for the blower motor. If it’s not running, there might be an issue
                                with the motor itself or the furnace's electrical components.</li>
                            <li>Flashing Lights: Some electric furnaces have a diagnostic LED light that can indicate
                                specific problems based on the pattern of flashes. Refer to your furnace’s manual to
                                decipher any codes.</li>
                            <li>Vents and Registers: Make sure all vents and registers in the house are open and not
                                blocked by furniture or curtains. Blocked vents can cause the system to overheat.</li>
                            <li>Check for Obvious Signs of Damage: Look for any visible signs of damage or wear on your
                                furnace and its components. Do not attempt to fix electrical components yourself, but
                                noting any visible problems can help when you call a professional.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If you've checked these things and your furnace still isn't working, or if you're unsure
                            about performing any of these checks safely, it's time to call a qualified heating
                            specialist. They can diagnose and fix more complex issues that require specific tools and
                            knowledge, such as problems with the furnace's electrical connections, heating elements, or
                            internal controls.</p>
