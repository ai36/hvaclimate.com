                        <summary>Gas furnace blow cold air. What can I do?</summary>
                        <p>
                            If your gas boiler is blowing cold air, it could indicate several potential issues. Here are some steps you can take to diagnose and possibly fix the problem:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Check the thermostat: Make sure the thermostat is set to heating mode and the temperature is set higher than the current room temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Verify programming settings: If you have a programmable thermostat, ensure it's programmed correctly for the time of day and desired temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect air filters: Clogged filters can obstruct normal airflow, reducing heating efficiency. If filters are dirty, replace them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check vents: Ensure all vents and registers are open and not blocked by furniture or drapes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Look for airflow blockages: Check external air ducts for any obstructions or clogs that could hinder air circulation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Restart the system: Sometimes, resetting the boiler can fix a temporary issue. Turn off the boiler's power for a few minutes, then turn it back on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inspect the burner flame: If you have access and knowledge, check to see if the boiler's burner flame is lit. A non-lit flame could indicate a gas supply problem or a burner malfunction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check the heating system for leaks: Leaks in the heating system can lead to heat loss and insufficient heating.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            If the problem persists after these steps or you're unsure about performing them, it's strongly recommended to contact a professional heating technician for service and repair. A technician can accurately diagnose the issue and suggest the appropriate repairs. Attempting to intervene without
                            proper knowledge and skills can be dangerous.

                        <summary>Gas furnace leaking water. What should you do first?</summary>
                        <p>If your gas furnace is leaking water, it's important to address the issue promptly to prevent
                            further damage to your furnace and your home. Here's what you should do first:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Turn Off the Power to the Furnace: Safety first. Before inspecting or touching your
                                furnace, ensure that the power is turned off. This can usually be done at the furnace
                                switch or the main electrical panel.</li>
                            <li>Identify the Source of the Leak: Try to locate where the water is coming from. Common
                                sources of leaks in a gas furnace include the condensation line, the humidifier (if your
                                furnace is equipped with one), or the heat exchanger.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Condensation Leak: High-efficiency gas furnaces produce condensation which is
                                    drained away from the unit. A clogged condensation drain or a break in the line can
                                    cause leaks.</li>
                                <li>Humidifier Leak: If your furnace has an integrated humidifier, it might be leaking
                                    water due to a clog or malfunction.</li>
                                <li>Heat Exchanger Leak: This is more serious, as it could indicate a crack in the heat
                                    exchanger, which can lead to a carbon monoxide leak.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Contain the Leak: If possible, try to contain the leak by placing a bucket or towels to
                                catch the water. This can help minimize water damage to your home while you work on a
                                more permanent solution.</li>
                            <li>Inspect and Clear the Condensate Line: If the leak is coming from the condensate line,
                                check for any clogs or blockages. You can try to clear the line yourself using a wet/dry
                                vacuum on the line's exterior end.</li>
                            <li>Check the Furnace Filter: A dirty furnace filter can restrict airflow, causing the coil
                                to freeze and then leak water when it melts. If the filter is dirty, replace it.</li>
                            <li>Call a Professional: Unless the solution is simple and safe, like changing a dirty
                                filter or unclogging a condensation line, it's best to call a professional HVAC
                                technician. This is especially true if you suspect the leak is coming from the heat
                                exchanger or if you can't identify the source of the leak.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Remember, regular maintenance of your furnace can help prevent issues like water leaks. Make
                            sure to have your furnace inspected and serviced by a professional annually.</p>

                                Clogged Condensate Lines: The condensate from high-efficiency gas furnaces must be
                                removed through special lines. Clogging of these lines can cause noise. Check and clean
                                the condensate lines.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improper Installation: If the furnace is improperly installed or if there are issues
                                with the ductwork, it can cause noise during operation. Contact a specialist to check
                                and adjust the installation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Wear and Tear: Over time, some worn-out furnace parts may begin to make noise. Regular
                                maintenance will help identify and replace worn parts before they cause problems.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>General Recommendations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular Maintenance: Regular checks and maintenance can prevent many issues, including
                                noise.</li>
                            <li>Professional Diagnosis: If you're unsure of the cause of the noise or how to fix it,
                                it's best to seek help from a professional HVAC technician.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <summary>Gas furnace not working. What to check before calling a specialist?</summary>
                        <p>Before calling a professional for a non-working gas furnace, here are a few things you can
                            check:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Thermostat Settings: Ensure the thermostat is set to "heat" and the temperature setting
                                is higher than the current room temperature.</li>
                            <li>Power Supply: Check if the furnace switch is turned on. Also, verify that the circuit
                                breaker hasn’t tripped or a fuse hasn’t blown.</li>
                            <li>Furnace Filter: A dirty filter can restrict airflow and cause the furnace to not operate
                                properly. Check and replace the filter if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Pilot Light (for older furnaces): If your furnace has a pilot light, make sure it’s lit.
                                If it’s out, follow the manufacturer's instructions to relight it.</li>
                            <li>Gas Supply: Verify that the gas valve to the furnace is fully open. Also, check if other
                                gas appliances in the house are working to rule out a gas supply issue.</li>
                            <li>Air Vents and Returns: Make sure all air vents and returns are open and not obstructed
