    <p>If your gas furnace is leaking water, it's important to address the issue promptly to prevent further damage to your furnace and your home. Here's what you should do first:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn Off the Power to the Furnace: Safety first. Before inspecting or touching your furnace, ensure that the power is turned off. This can usually be done at the furnace switch or the main electrical panel.</li>
        <li>Identify the Source of the Leak: Try to locate where the water is coming from. Common sources of leaks in a gas furnace include the condensation line, the humidifier (if your furnace is equipped with one), or the heat exchanger.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Condensation Leak: High-efficiency gas furnaces produce condensation which is drained away from the unit. A clogged condensation drain or a break in the line can cause leaks.</li>
            <li>Humidifier Leak: If your furnace has an integrated humidifier, it might be leaking water due to a clog or malfunction.</li>
            <li>Heat Exchanger Leak: This is more serious, as it could indicate a crack in the heat exchanger, which can lead to a carbon monoxide leak.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Contain the Leak: If possible, try to contain the leak by placing a bucket or towels to catch the water. This can help minimize water damage to your home while you work on a more permanent solution.</li>
        <li>Inspect and Clear the Condensate Line: If the leak is coming from the condensate line, check for any clogs or blockages. You can try to clear the line yourself using a wet/dry vacuum on the line's exterior end.</li>
        <li>Check the Furnace Filter: A dirty furnace filter can restrict airflow, causing the coil to freeze and then leak water when it melts. If the filter is dirty, replace it.</li>
        <li>Call a Professional: Unless the solution is simple and safe, like changing a dirty filter or unclogging a condensation line, it's best to call a professional HVAC technician. This is especially true if you suspect the leak is coming from the heat exchanger or if you can't identify the source of the leak.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, regular maintenance of your furnace can help prevent issues like water leaks. Make sure to have your furnace inspected and serviced by a professional annually.</p>
