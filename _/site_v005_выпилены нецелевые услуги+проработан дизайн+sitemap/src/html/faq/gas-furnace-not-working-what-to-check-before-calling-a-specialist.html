    <p>Before calling a professional for a non-working gas furnace, here are a few things you can check:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Thermostat Settings: Ensure the thermostat is set to "heat" and the temperature setting is higher than the current room temperature.</li>
        <li>Power Supply: Check if the furnace switch is turned on. Also, verify that the circuit breaker hasn’t tripped or a fuse hasn’t blown.</li>
        <li>Furnace Filter: A dirty filter can restrict airflow and cause the furnace to not operate properly. Check and replace the filter if necessary.</li>
        <li>Pilot Light (for older furnaces): If your furnace has a pilot light, make sure it’s lit. If it’s out, follow the manufacturer's instructions to relight it.</li>
        <li>Gas Supply: Verify that the gas valve to the furnace is fully open. Also, check if other gas appliances in the house are working to rule out a gas supply issue.</li>
        <li>Air Vents and Returns: Make sure all air vents and returns are open and not obstructed to ensure proper airflow.</li>
        <li>Furnace Door: Ensure the furnace door is properly closed. Some furnaces have a safety switch that prevents operation if the door is open.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have checked these items and the furnace still does not work, it may be time to call a professional. Regular maintenance can also prevent many issues from occurring.</p>
