    <p>If you smell gas coming from your gas furnace, it's a serious safety hazard that requires immediate attention. Hereâ€™s what you need to do without delay:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not attempt to turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights. This could trigger an explosion.</li>
        <li>Evacuate everyone from the building immediately. Do not try to locate the source of the gas leak inside.</li>
        <li>As you leave, open doors and windows to ventilate the area if it is safe to do so without delaying your exit.</li>
        <li>Once you are in a safe location, call your gas company's emergency number or the fire department to report the gas leak. Use a phone outside the house to avoid igniting the gas.</li>
        <li>Do not re-enter the building until it has been inspected and declared safe by professionals.</li>
        <li>If you know how to do it safely, turn off the gas supply valve to your home before leaving. This valve is typically located near the gas meter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, a gas leak is a serious risk to your safety and health, potentially leading to fires, explosions, or carbon monoxide poisoning. Always take immediate action and let professionals handle the situation.</p>
