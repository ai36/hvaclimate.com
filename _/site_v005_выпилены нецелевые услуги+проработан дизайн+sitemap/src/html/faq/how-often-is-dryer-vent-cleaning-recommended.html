        It is recommended to clean your dryer vent at least once a year to maintain optimal performance and safety. Over time, lint and debris can accumulate in the vent, reducing airflow and increasing the risk of fire. Regular cleaning helps prevent these issues and ensures your dryer operates efficiently. Additionally, if you notice any signs of reduced airflow or longer drying times, it's important to schedule a cleaning promptly. By prioritizing regular maintenance, you can extend the lifespan of your dryer and promote a safer environment in your home.
