    <p>If your air conditioner is leaking, there are several steps you can take:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Turn off the air conditioner:</strong> First and foremost, turn off the air conditioner to prevent further water leakage and potential damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Check the drain pipe:</strong> Often, a clogged drain pipe is the culprit. Try locating it (usually a plastic pipe coming out of the back of the air conditioner) and check for any obstructions or clogs. If it's blocked, you can clear it by using an air compressor or simply flushing it with water.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspect the filters:</strong> Clogged or dirty filters can cause the air conditioner to malfunction and, consequently, lead to leakage. Check the condition of the filters, and if they are dirty, clean or replace them.</li>
      <li><strong>Check the indoor drainage system:</strong> If the air conditioner is installed in a window or wall, ensure that its indoor drainage system is properly directed and water is being drained efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspect the refrigerant level:</strong> Sometimes, a water leak can be caused by low refrigerant, leading to ice buildup on the evaporator and subsequent thawing.</li>
      <li><strong>Seek professional assistance:</strong> If you're unable to determine the cause of the leak or resolve the issue on your own, it's recommended to contact a licensed air conditioning service professional. They can diagnose and fix the problem with your air conditioner.</li>
    </ol>
