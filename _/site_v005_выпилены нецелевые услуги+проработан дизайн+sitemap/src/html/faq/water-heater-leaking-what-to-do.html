        If your water heater is leaking, it can cause serious issues and requires prompt action. Here's what you should do:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Turn off the water supply:</b> Immediately shut off the water supply to the water heater. This will help prevent further damage and reduce the risk of flooding.</li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Turn off the electricity or gas:</b> If your water heater operates on electricity, switch it off using the breaker or main switch in your electrical panel. If it's a gas water heater, turn off the gas supply to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Call professionals:</b> Don't attempt to repair the water heater yourself, especially if you don't have experience. Call licensed water heater repair specialists to assess the situation and take necessary actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Temporarily patch the leak:</b> If the leak is coming from pipes or connections, you can try temporarily stopping it using special pipe-sealing materials (such as adhesive or repair tape). However, remember that this is only a temporary solution, and qualified repair is required.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Remember that a leaking water heater poses a serious risk to your home and safety. Follow the steps above to minimize damage and ensure the safety of your home and family.
