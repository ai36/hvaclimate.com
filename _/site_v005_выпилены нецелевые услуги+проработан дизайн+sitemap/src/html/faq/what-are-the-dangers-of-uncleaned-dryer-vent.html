        Uncleaned dryer vents pose several dangers to your home and safety. Accumulated lint and debris restrict airflow, causing the dryer to work harder and potentially overheat. This can lead to increased energy consumption and a higher risk of fire. In fact, clogged dryer vents are a leading cause of house fires. Additionally, poor ventilation can result in longer drying times and decreased efficiency of your dryer. Mold and mildew growth may also occur in the moist environment created by trapped lint. Regular cleaning is crucial to prevent these hazards and ensure a safe, efficient dryer.
