    <p>
        There are several signs that indicate the need for dryer vent cleaning. Firstly, if your clothes are taking longer than usual to dry, it could be due to a clogged vent restricting airflow. You may also notice a musty odor emanating from the dryer or laundry room, which could indicate trapped moisture and lint buildup. Additionally, if the exterior of your dryer feels unusually hot to the touch during operation, it may be struggling to expel hot air properly. Lastly, visible lint accumulation around the dryer vent or on the lint screen is a clear sign that cleaning is necessary.
