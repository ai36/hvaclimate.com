    <p>If you're experiencing unpleasant odors or colors in your water, it could be attributed to several factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Bacteria growth:</strong> Bacteria can develop in the water heater tank, especially if the temperature is not set high enough to inhibit their growth. This can result in foul odors, often described as "rotten egg" smells.</li>
      <li><strong>Sediment accumulation:</strong> Sediment buildup in the water heater tank can lead to discolored water. Minerals like iron or manganese can cause the water to appear yellow, red, or brown.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrosion:</strong> Corrosion within the plumbing system or water heater can cause metallic tastes or odors in the water.</li>
      <li><strong>Chemical contaminants:</strong> Chemical pollutants in the water supply can also cause unpleasant odors or colors. This could be due to industrial or agricultural runoff contaminating the water source.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you're experiencing these issues, it's advisable to have your water tested by a professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment options.</p>
