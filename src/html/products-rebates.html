        If you're installing new energy-efficient equipment or replacing old systems, you may be eligible for various savings. A federal tax credit typically covers 30% of the project cost, up to $2,000. You could also receive a rebate from your county, which can be up to $1,000 depending on your location. Additionally, your utility provider might offer rebates, also up to $1,000. In most cases, the total reimbursement can be up to $3,000 in Oregon and up to $2,800 in Washington. Our specialist will help estimate your savings when preparing your project quote.
