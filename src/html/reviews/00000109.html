    "rwtext": "After trying 3 different HVA companies with no results, we gave HVA Climate Control LLC a try. We couldn't be more pleased. They showed up on time, diagnosed the problem and returned in a week with the new part and installed it in less than 15 minutes! It's working like a champ! The technicians were polite, answered all our questions and did excellent work. They are applying the fee they charge to initially come out to the house toward the price of the part and repair. They never asked for money up front. They will be sending an invoice. It's so nice to do business with a reliable and honest company. We'd recommend them to anyone! Great job! Thanks so much.",
